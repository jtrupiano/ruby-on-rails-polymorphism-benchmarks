Ruby on Rails Polymorphic Relation Benchmarking
Nick Gauthier (nick@smartlogicsolutions.com)

I created this app to test the polymorphic relationships in rails.

Specifically, I wanted to know if using strings for comparison was slower
than using a manual linking table via integers.

I created four linking tables, two with strings and two with integers.
One of each type has an index on the type, the other does not.

Please expand upon my benchmarks to find the fastest way possible to create and
(more importantly) find these links.

Edit the file test/test_helper.rb to set parameters. Run with "rake"
